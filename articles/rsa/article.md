# RSA cryptosystem: overview &amp; implementations

The main goal of this article is to introduce to the readers, the main features of the RSA cryptosystem, the underlying theoretical concepts and propose two implementations: one in Python and another one in C++.

## Introduction

**RSA** (**R**ivest, **S**hamir and **A**dleman) is an asymmetric cryptography system (also known as a public-key principle crytography sustem).
It is widely used, since its release in 1977, to strenghten the transmission of highly-sensitive data.


## Theory part

$$\varphi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)$$

## Practice: Implementations

### Implementation in Python

```python
def encrypt(p: int = 0, q: int = 2) -> bool:
    """
    :return:
    """

    return a
```

### Implmentation in C++

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stderr>
int main(int argc, char** argv){
    return 0;
}
```
