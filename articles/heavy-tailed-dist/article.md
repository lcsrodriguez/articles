# Overview of heavy-tailed distribution


## Introduction


There exists many ways to identify the type of tailed thickness of a given probability distribution.

One of the most classical techniques is to use the exponential function as a benchmark measure with respect to the considered distribution.

Let $X$ be a non-negative random with a cumulative distribution function (cdf) $F(x) = \mathbb{P}(X \leq x)$. We denote $\overline{F}$ its **survival distribution function** (sdf) defined as follows:

$$
\forall x > 0, \ \overline{F}(x) = 1 - F(x) = \mathbb{P}(X > x)
$$
